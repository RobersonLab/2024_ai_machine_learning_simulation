# Blood pressure classification simulation
This repository was used to generate figures for a primer on LLM usage for clinicians.

Blood pressure data
- [Women's dataset from the "Predicting increased blood pressure using Machine Learning" paper](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Women_s_dataset_from_the_Predicting_increased_blood_pressure_using_Machine_Learning_paper/845664)
- [Data tsv download link](https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/1274410)

## Setup
1. Clone the project.
2. Download the data from the TSV download link. It should be a file named "femtodos.txt". Look, I would prefer to download it in the scripting. But regardless of method (libcurl, internal, curl, wget), the output was always wrong. Humor me and just download the file yourself.
3. Install all required packages ().
4. Run analysis scripts in order. That's it.
